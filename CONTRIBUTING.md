##Yocto+SPDX Code Submission Policy

Contributions to the Yocto+SPDX project are welcome.  

There are three ways to submit code to Yocto-SPDX.

1. The preferred method is to fork the repository and make a pull request.  The
Yocto+SPDX maintainers will review the code before merging it. For help with
pull requests: (https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) For
general help see:
(https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/)

2. The second method is to contact the maintainers via email.  Email addresses
for the current project maintainers are found in the README file
(https://github.com/ttgurney/yocto-spdx/blob/master/README.md).  Code will be
reviewed by the UNO Yocto+SPDX group before being merged. 

3. The last method is to ask for direct access to the Yocto-SPDX GitHub
repository. This method will be considered for regular contributors who have
shown the abilty to work within the community. To make this request, please
contact the project maintainers by email.

###All patch submissions require documentation.

For each commit, provide a single-line summary of the change, and in the body
of the commit message, provide a detailed description of what you did. The only
exceptions to the latter are if your change is a simple and self-explanatory
one that needs no further explanation.

If the change addresses a specific issue in the GitHub issue tracker, include a
reference to the issue ID in your detailed description.  Example commit
message:

     Fixes [Yocto-SPDX #<bug-id>]

     <detailed description of change>
