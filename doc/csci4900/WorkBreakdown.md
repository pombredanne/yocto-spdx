###UNO Yocto+SPDX Group Internal Code Submission Plan
In order to avoid duplication, unless the code was specifically assigned to that group member, individuals should notify the group via email when they are working on code. All group members have the ability to commit code to the GitHub Repository.    
Analysis of new code and decisions regarding previous versions of the code will be determined by group discussion during normally scheduled meetings. 

SPDX dev server is the shared development environment for UNO Yocto+SPDX group. All group members have admin rights.
spdxdev.ist.unomaha.edu

This is the team server for running Yocto builds, local FOSSology scans and
other processes requiring significant system resources.
