Yocto+SPDX
==========

Overview
--------
Yocto+SPDX is a plugin that integrates SPDX document generation into the
Yocto Project build process.

SPDX is a standard format for communicating information about the licenses and
copyrights associated with a software package.  (https://www.spdx.org)

The Yocto Project is an open source collaboration project that provides
templates, tools and methods to help create custom Linux-based systems for
embedded products regardless of the hardware architecture.
(http://www.yoctoproject.org). 

The original Yocto+SPDX was written by Liang Cao and Jake Cloyd and was hosted
at the University of Nebraska Omaha.  The current incarnation of Yocto+SPDX
removes much of the complexity from the original project and replaces it with
DoSOCS.  DoSOCS is a command line tool that creates and prints SPDX documents
and uses a MySQL database for caching and storage.
